        <p>Tumbang Preso, also known as tumba lata or bato lata, is a cherished traditional Filipino street game that has been enjoyed by generations of children across the Philippines. Its name derives from the Filipino words tumba (to fall) and preso (prisoner), translating to "fallen prisoner" .</p>
        <p><strong>Origins and Cultural Significance</strong>
While the exact origins of Tumbang Preso are not well-documented, it is believed to have originated in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period. The game likely evolved from a blend of indigenous Filipino games and influences from Spanish culture . Played in backyards, streets, and open areas, Tumbang Preso has been passed down through generations, reflecting the creativity and communal spirit of Filipino youth.</p>

          <h1>Gameplay Mechanics</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Tumbang Preso is typically played with a group of children, requiring minimal equipment: an empty can and a slipper (or pamato) for each player. One player is designated as the "It" (tay√†), who guards the can placed within a drawn circle. The other players aim to knock down the can by throwing their slippers from behind a designated line. If a player successfully topples the can, they must quickly retrieve their slipper before the "It" can return the can to its position and tag them. If tagged, the player becomes the new "It" .</p>
